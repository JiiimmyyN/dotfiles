To me, the way I understood your message, is: 
- Lack of trust (from retro): Trust is a two way street, I think the feeling is mutual, doesn't feel like we are trusted either. 
- Cycle / Pitch preparation - do you agree with the things I brought up?
-  





- Do you want to continue working here?: Honestly, don't know... the atmosphere in the team is... well not good. The 
  interview process is very stressful for me so therefore I very rarely change unless I know next job will be better.
- Scoping issues, planning: This is the reason I posted my checklist, I believe these are issues that keep coming up and impact scope and shows lack of planning
