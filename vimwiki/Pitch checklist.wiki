---- Pitch Checklist ----
Things that I think should be answered during writing of the pitch OR at least before betting
If answer to any of these questions is *yes* it should probably be mentioned in the key-results

- Do the action added/modified in the pitch create a History note? (or should it?)
- Do the action added/modified in the pitch create a API subscription event? (or should it? https://lime-go.readme.io/reference/eventsubscription )
- Can you import the type worked on in the pitch through the Admin migration OR new import in the app?
- What other types have links to the type worked on in the pitch, will these changes impact how they are displayed or any API calls?
- Are the parameters we modified in the pitch involved in any sort of external sync (ERP, Calendar, Other?)
