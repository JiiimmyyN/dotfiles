How to properly tackle tech debt
- A lot of deprecated services (not really tech debt, at least not the type I think about)
- Started elastic (sort of? but not really, always something else coming in the way causing us to drop it, lack of commitment?)
- Sometime at the start of the year there was a discussion and said that we would always have one (1) person working on something tech debt related
